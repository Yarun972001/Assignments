    • What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

      other elements next to it.

 Example: 

<h1>-<h6> : This element is used for including headings of different sizes ranging from 1 to 6.
<div>: This is a container tag and is used to make separate divisions of content on the web page.
<hr>: This is an empty tag and is used for separating content by horizontal lines.
<li>: This tag is used for including list items of an ordered or unordered list.
<ul>: This tag is used to make an unordered list.
<ol>: This tag is used to make an ordered list.
<p>: This tag is used to include paragraphs of content in the webpage.
<table>: This tag is used for including the tables in the webpage when there is a need for tabular data.

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<!--Meta data-->
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"
		content="IE=edge">
	<meta name="viewport"
		content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

	<!--The description written on title tag
		get appeared as browser tab name-->
	<title>Geeks For Geeks </title>

	<style>
		h1 {
			color: #006600;
			text-align: center;
			border: 2px solid #091418;
			background-color: yellow;
		}
		.container {
			border: 2px solid #040804;
			background-color: slategray;
		}
		p{
			border: 2px solid #040804;
			background-color: #4089c5;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<!-- Whatever content in the body tag
	appears on the webpage -->

<body>
	<div class="container" >
		<h1>Geeks for Geeks(h1) </h1>
		
<p>
			This is a paragraph example of block
			element which occupied whole width (p)
		</p>

	</div>
</body>

</html>

--->  Inline elements: Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don’t start from a new line  
      and don’t have top and bottom margins as block elements have.

<a>: This tag is used for including hyperlinks in the webpage.
<br>: This tag is used for mentioning line breaks in the webpage wherever needed.
<script> : This tag is used for including external and internal JavaScript codes.
<input>: This tag is used for taking input from the users and is mainly used in forms.
<img>: This tag is used for including different images in the webpage to add beauty to the webpage.
<span>:  This is an inline container that takes necessary space only.
<b>:  This tag is used in places where bold text is needed.
<label>: The tag in HTML is used to provide a usability improvement for mouse users i.e, if a user clicks on the text within the <label> element, it toggles the control.
